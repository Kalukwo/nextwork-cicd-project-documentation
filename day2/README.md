# DevOps Project - Day 2: GitHub Repo Integration with AWS EC2

This project is part of a 7-day DevOps learning series focused on building a CI/CD pipeline. On Day 2, I set up version control for my web application by connecting a local Git repository hosted on an AWS EC2 instance to a remote GitHub repository using GitHub access tokens.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Git
- GitHub
- AWS EC2
- VS Code
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT)

## 🗂️ What I Did

- Installed Git on the EC2 instance and verified the installation
- Initialized a local Git repository inside the project directory
- Configured Git identity with name and email
- Connected the local repo to GitHub using HTTPS and a Personal Access Token
- Used Git commands to add, commit, and push code (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- Troubleshot authentication issues related to GitHub tokens
- Made and pushed changes to confirm GitHub integration

## 💡 Key Learnings

- How Git tracks project history and collaborates with GitHub as a remote repository
- Why GitHub tokens are used instead of passwords for secure HTTPS connections
- How to handle staging, committing, and pushing updates from EC2 to GitHub

## 🧠 Reflection

This day was both challenging and insightful, especially when dealing with authentication via access tokens. Successfully pushing changes and seeing them reflected on GitHub was very rewarding.

## 📅 Timeline

- Time Spent: ~2 hours
- Project Dates: April 12th – April 13th, 2025 (Day 2 completed)
