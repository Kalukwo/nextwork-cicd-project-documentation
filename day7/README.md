# DevOps Project - Day 7: End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline

This project is part of a 7-day DevOps learning series focused on building a CI/CD pipeline. On Day 7, I implemented a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline to automate deployments from GitHub to production via CodeBuild and CodeDeploy.

## üóÇÔ∏è What I Did

- Set up a CodePipeline to automate the flow from GitHub (source) to CodeDeploy (production deployment)
- Configured three CI/CD pipeline stages:
  - **Source**: Connected GitHub as the source repository with webhook events for automatic triggers
  - **Build**: Used AWS CodeBuild to compile and package the Java web app using artifacts from GitHub
  - **Deploy**: Deployed build artifacts to EC2 using AWS CodeDeploy and an existing deployment group
- Enabled superceded execution mode in CodePipeline to prioritize the latest run and cancel outdated ones
- Verified the pipeline by pushing changes to the GitHub repository and observing successful live deployment
