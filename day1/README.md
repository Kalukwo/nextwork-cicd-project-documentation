# DevOps Project - Day 1: Web App Setup on AWS using VS Code

This project is part of a 7-day DevOps learning series focused on building a CI/CD pipeline. On Day 1, I set up a Java-based web application hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using VS Code and SSH.

- How to remotely develop and edit server-side files using VS Code
- Basics of Maven archetypes and folder structure for Java web apps

## 🧠 Reflection

This day was more challenging than expected due to several SSH connection issues, but solving them provided a deeper understanding of cloud-based development environments.

## 📅 Timeline
